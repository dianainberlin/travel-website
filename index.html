          <h2 class="section-title">Lisbon, the city of seven hills</h2>
          <p class="section-content">
            The legend has it that Lisbon was named Olissipo by the Romans, for
            its resemblance to the Roman capital. Just like Rome, Lisbon began
            its life as a humble settlement nestled among seven hills. However,
            it wasn't until the 17th century, in the writing of Frey Nicolao
            d'Oliveira, that Lisbon came to be called 'a cidade das sete
            colinas' - the city of seven hills.
          </p>
          <p class="section-content">
            You can still see traces of ancient Lisbon today. Beyond the array
            of shops with international brands, peaceful streetside cafes
            selling the iconic pastel de nata and world class restaurants with a
            variety of global cuisine, you can still wander the seven hills and
            see the city from above, taking in the rolling terracotta rooftops,
            the whitewashed walls and on the horizon, the soft blue sea.

            Café Janis A lively all-day café with an outdoor terrace that serves
            everything you could want from breakfast and brunch to evening
            cocktails. Address: 1A Rua Moeda What I like about it This is one of
            the best brunch spots in Lisbon but if you go at any time of day
            there will be something delicious on the menu!

            variety of breakfast and brunch options. Address: Rua da Palmeira 23

            staff are so friendly.
